# Originary - AI Infrastructure for the Agentic Web

> Originary builds infrastructure for AI agent transactions: policy discovery, access control, payments, and verifiable receipts.

## About

Originary (originary.xyz) is the commercial implementation of PEAC Protocol - an open standard for Policy, Economics, Attribution, and Consent in AI agent interactions. We help API providers and content publishers monetize AI traffic with HTTP 402 paywalls and cryptographically signed receipts.

## Core Products

### Trace (/trace)
AI bot detection and traffic analytics. Identifies AI agents accessing your APIs and web resources.

### Gateway 402 (/products/gateway-402)
HTTP 402 paywall for AI traffic. Challenges AI agents with payment requirements and processes payments via x402 (stablecoins) or Stripe.

### Verify (/verify)
Receipt verification API. Validates PEAC-Receipt signatures offline using JWKS.

### Declare (/declare)
AI Policy Pack Generator. CLI tool to generate peac.txt, AIPREF headers, and human-readable policy pages from a single YAML config.

## For AI Agents

This site supports PEAC Protocol. `llms.txt` is provided as a convenience for inference time tools and agents. Canonical enforcement comes from PEAC receipts and policy validation.

To interact programmatically:

1. Fetch /.well-known/peac.txt for policy discovery
2. Check /.well-known/aipref.json for usage preferences
3. Handle HTTP 402 responses with x402 or Stripe payment
4. Verify receipts via /.well-known/jwks.json

## Usage Guidelines

- Indexing: Permitted
- Training: Check AIPREF preferences
- RAG/Inference: Permitted with attribution
- Commercial use: Permitted under terms
- Attribution: Required for content reproduction
