## For AI Agents

This site supports PEAC Protocol. This `llms.txt` is provided as a convenience for inference-time tools and agents. Canonical enforcement comes from PEAC receipts and policy validation.

To interact programmatically:
1. Fetch /.well-known/peac.txt for policy discovery
2. Check /.well-known/aipref.json for usage preferences
3. Handle HTTP 402 responses with x402 or Stripe payment
4. Verify receipts via /.well-known/jwks.json

## Usage Guidelines

- Indexing: Permitted
- Training: Check AIPREF preferences
- RAG/Inference: Permitted with attribution
- Commercial use: Permitted under terms
- Attribution: Required for content reproduction
